# Prework - *KamehameTap*

Submitted by: **Dylan Yanez**

**KamehameTap** is an app that randomly changes your screen’s background color and displays a rotating selection of Dragon Ball–themed images each time you tap the “Surprise Me!” button.

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## Additional Features

The following features are also implemented:

- [x] Cycles through five Dragon Ball–related images on button taps
- [x] Displays a `UIImageView` at the bottom of the screen to show the current image
- [x] Maintains a circular index so after reaching the last image, it goes back to the first

## App Brainstorming

1. **Spotify**
   - Ability to listen to music
   - Great at suggesting similar songs when your playlist runs dry

2. **Musi**
   - Ability to play music not typically found in spotify or apple music, like edits of songs
   - No user signup necessary
3. **TikTok**  
   - Short-form video format 
   - Algorithm that leads you to have a curated homepage of videos aligned with your interests.
   - Ability to engage with the community (comments, going live etc...)
   
4. **Youtube**
   - Wide range of both entertaining and informative video content
   - Ability to engage with the community (comments, going live etc...)

## New App Idea

My idea is for an app that combines various popular features into a new streaming service. It would have a personalized music recommendation system with openness to all kinds of music as well as having a comment system for users to interact with one another.
   
## Notes

Some challenges I encountered while building the app were creating the function that returns a random background color each time the button is tapped, as well as loading images through a url. I looked online for a clear explanation of how to create a random color in Swift and how to load and display images.
